For the first sprint, a lot of my early work that I did, shown by example in Register.html,
ended up being integrated into other's works. The rest of the sprint, I attempted to work on
a way to recover a users password and uploading files. For the second sprint, the uploading
script was handed over.

Throughout the course of the first sprint, I have to say that our team did quite a good job
at communicating with each other. I believe that there is nothing to discuss that we will not 
forget.

Personally, I learnt a lot about working within a team to design and develop a web application
and along with that, the potential usefulness of Agile within a company and team environment.
